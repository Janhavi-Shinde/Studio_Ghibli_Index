NOTE: The public Studio Ghibli API that I'm using is current undergoing maintenance/ having some issues, hence why the results aren't being generated. I appreciate your patience as this issue gets fixed, as it is out my hands. I am currently working on some replacment data so that this application can still be used, but please watch my code walkthorugh to see what this application looks like and how I made it: https://flip.com/s/ccBeiiFHW9tp :) 

This is a JavaScript application created using the Studio Ghibli API. 

You can use the search bar to search for Ghibli movies by movie title OR by the directors name!

You will also be able to find out more information by clicking on the description button provided!

If you see a movie you liked, click on the loveheart to really 'like' it!

Have fun exploring Ghibli films! If you have any suggestions on how I can improve your user experience or improve the website in general, I would greatly appreciate your feedback!
